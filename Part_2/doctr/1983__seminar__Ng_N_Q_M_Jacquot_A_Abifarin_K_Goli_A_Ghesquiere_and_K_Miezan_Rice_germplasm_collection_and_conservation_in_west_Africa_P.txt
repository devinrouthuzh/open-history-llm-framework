INTRODUCTION
There are seven species of rice indigenous to Africa (Table 1).
Those species with the genome A, namely: Oryza longistaminata,
0. barthii, 0. stapfii and 0. glaberrima appeared to be of immediate
interest to plant breeders. They can cross freely with the Asian
rice, 0. sativa and gene transfer from one species to another is
possible, although their F1 hybrids are male sterile. The gene pools
of these African species can be exploited to improve the quality and
quantity of the Asian rice. The gene pools of other rice species of
African origin possessing genomes BB, BBCC and FF represent ted by
0. eichingeri, 0. punctata and 0. brachy ant tha can also be exploited
if plant breeders and geneticists are willing to struggle with the
strong crossing barriers between these species and the cultivated
rice.
In addition, the African land races of 0. sativa represent
another important genetic diversity of rice germplasm in Africa.
This species reached East Africa about 2,000 years ago and to West
Africa about 450 years ago and possibly even earlier (Carpen ter,
1978; Nayar, 1973 and Porteres, 1950). For hundreds of years,
0. sativa has evolved under African ecosystems that are differen t
from its home lands in Asia. During this period, the occurrence of

mutation and recombination due to occassional outcrossing
followed by natural and artificial (by farmers) selections would
have created a considerable genetic diversity in the spe cies.
Furthermore, int trogression of genes from O. glaberrima and other
species with the genome AA to 0. sativa or vice versa might have
taken place. Natural hybrids between 0. sativa and 0. glaberrima
have been observed in farmers fields (Ng, 1979) and in the multi-
plication plots of IITA. This phenomenon is also speculated by
Second (1981). This process of outcrossing would certainly have
enriched the genetic variability of rices in Africa.
The importance of collecting and preserving Afri can rices had
been stressed in several workshops and in literatures (IRAT/ORSTOM,
1977; IRRI, 1978; Ng, 1982a and Williams 1978) . Several organizations
in West Africa, i.e., Organisation de la Recherche Scientifique et
Technique AOutre-Mer/Institue de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales
et des Cultures Vivrieres (ORSTOM/IRAT) I Institut des Savanes
(IDESSA), International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) I
International Institute of Tropical. Agriculture (IITA), and West
Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA) have been actively
collecting rice germplasm in Africa during the past several years.
In addition, the National Institute of Japan had also conducted
a study tour to several West African coun tries from which the
rice germplasm was also collected. This paper summarizes the
progress made on the collection and conservation of rice by ORSTOM/
IRAT, IDESSA, IITA and WARDA in Africa.

The Role of ORSTOM/IRAT, IDESSA, IITA and WARDA in Germplasm
Collection and Conservation
IDESSA is a national institute of Ivory Coast which works
closely with ORSTOM and IRAT in the collection, multiplication
and evaluation of rice germplasm and the studies of interspecific
crosses among the group of sativa complex.
IRAT and ORSTOM are two regional research organizations in
(mainly Francophone)
African coun tries, which are financed by the government
of France. These two organizations have regional offices in Ivory
Coast. IRAT/ORSTOM initiated a genetic resources program on
African rices in Africa in 1974. By 1977, they were coordinating
and executing rice collecting missions sponsored by IBPGR, IITA,
IRRI, WARDA and ORSTOM/IRAT in West Africa.
IRAT was until now responsible to dispatch the multiplied seed
samples to IITA, IRRI and WARDA for preservation and utilization.
ORSTOM, IRAT and IDESSA store working collections for their own
evaluation and studies.
ORSTOM's research activities focus on the studies of genetic
variability and diversity, origin and phytogenetic relationship
of the species belonging to the sativa. group. IRAT's evaluation
activities mainly focus on the ident tification of donors for plan t
breeding, espec cially agronomic characters and characters favoring
outcrossing.
IITA established a Genetic Resources Unit in late 1975. The
major responsibility of the Unit is to conserve plant genetic
resources in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its duties are to collect,
conserve, evaluate, study and document the genetic resources of



-4-
crops - mainly within the IITA's mandata including rice.
IITA has a Rice Improvement Program working in close
côllaboration with IRRI, WARDA, IRAT and African national programs
in the improvement. of rice specific to African region. IITA had
been designated by the IBPGR as a regional base cen ter for
preserving African form of 0. sativa (IBPGR, 1979). In addition,
IITA had also been recommended to preserve, rejuvenate and
distribute cultivars of 0. glaberrima and wild species of Africa
at the 1977 Workshop on Rice Genetic Conservation at IRRI, Los
Banos (IRRI, 1978). IITA accepted these responsibilities and
worked in close collaboration with IRAT/ORSTOM, IBPGR, IRRI,
WARDA and the African National Institutes to achieve - these goals.
IITA's research on germplasm included the study of the
variability in grain characteristics, in reaction to rice yellow
mottle virus and to blast and other stresses.
WARDA's germplasm program is to extend logistic or
administrative support to IITA, IRAT, IBPGR and IRRI, etc., when
needed for germplasm collection. It also conserves, evaluates,
distributes, and promotes the utilization of rice germplasm in
collaboration with IITA and IRAT. Furthermore, WARDA also collects
in certain key areas where IITA and ORSTOM/IRAT have not colle cted
or not sufficiently collected.
Collaborations between these organizations operating in Africa
in rice germplasm exploration and collection have been extreme: ly
good. The collected materials from Africa are shared among these
organizations including IRRI. IDESSA, IITA, ORSTOM and IRAT

acknowledge
the role of the IBPGR in coordinating, promoting and
supporting the germplasm collection and conservation.
Progress in Field Collection and Assemblage of Rice Germplasm
There were a total of 58 missions conducted by ORSTOM/IRAT/
IDESSA, WARDA and IITA to 23 African nations during 1974-1982 and
collected 7,789 samples. The collecting missions performed by
each institute are presented in Tables 2, 3, & 4.
ORSTOW/IRAT/IDESSA 'started the exploration activities in
1974 and by 1982, these organizations had completed 18 exploration
missions to 11 African nations from which a total of 3,176 rice
sa amples were collected (Table 2).
WARDA had conducted two explorations to Mali and Nigeria
during 1979-1980. During the two trips it had gathered 666 samples
of rice consisting of different species
(Table 3).
IITA began its plant exploration activities in 1976. By 1980
the Unit had successfully accomplished 38 plant collecting missions
to 18 African countries and collected a total of 3,942 samples
(Table 4). Besides the field collections, IITA has in addition
received through donations, 3,473 accessions of rice (mainly
collected in Africa) from ORSTOM/IRAT, IRRI, WARDA, IBPGR and
African national programs. Now IITA holds a total of 7,633
accessions consisting of 1,941 0. glaberrima and 5,600 0. sativa
accessions and 92 accessions of other species (Table 5). The
growth of the germplasm bank of rice at IITA is shown in Figure 1.

Ge: rmplasm Preservation
At IITA, seeds after harvest were dried at 40°C for 3-4 days,
then threshed, cleaned and fumigated with phosphine gas before
storage. Seeds for working collection are, at present t, stored
in plastic jars in a short term seed store (400 m3) maintained at
around 20°C and 408 relative humidity (R.H.). Parts of the working
collection of rice and other germplasm at IITA will soon be
transferred. to another seed store (225 m3) which is operated at
5°C and less than 658 R.H. In the future IITA hopes to construct an
additional 5°C cold store in order to keep all the available
germplasm at IITA.
A seed store operated at -18°C for long term seed conservation
was commissioned during 1982. This store is 24 ft wide, 15 ft long
and 7 ft 10 in high and has a capacity for 48,000 aluminum cans 99 mm
high and 46 mm in di ameter. Each can hold about 70 9 of rice seeds
and two cans of seeds of every rice accessions will be stored. IITA
is also in the process of acquiring additional fund to install
another long term seed st tore to accommodate all the available
germplasm, besides rice.
Rice seeds with a percentage viability of above 878 are
dried to a moisture con tent of 6-78, then sealed in aluminum cans for
long term storage at -18°C. Seeds' under this conditions is expected
to remain viable for more than 50 years.



-7-
At IRAT, a duplicate set of each germplasm accession is
stored in 5°C cold store for preservation and anot ther set is kept
as a working collection in a store room with the ordinary wall type
air-conditioners.
ORSTOM has a store room operated at 5°C for keeping a
working collection of rice germplasm. A very small quan tity of
seeds of each rice accessions were preserved in a deep freezer for
use as a reference sample.
WARDA is in a process of installing two walk-in chambers
of a total volume of 59 m3 with a capacity of holding 12,000
accessions.
Germplasm Characterization, Evaluation and Documentation
Characterization and evaluation of germplasm are a major
activity of an active genetic resources cent ter. They enable
scientists to study the diversity of a species, search for material
for direct introduction as cultivars, or provide genetic variability
in breedingprograms.
At IITA, the rice accession is grown in the main growing
season in the fields for agrobotanical characterization and
evaluation, after the initial seed increase and purification.
Forty-four agrobotanical charàcters are scored for each accessions
using the des criptors recomment ded by the IBPGR/IRRI Rice Advisory
Commi ttee (IRRI, 1980). During the growing period of rice for
seed multiplication or characterization, IITA's rice scient tist ts
also evaluate the germplasm, particularly for the characters such



-8-
as resistance to insect pests and diseases and to select varieties
which are agronomically superior.
These rice germplasm multiplication and characterization plots
also serve as parental plots for use in the hybridization by rice
breeders. Very promising materials are selected for further
testing.
Special efforts have been made to screen the rice germplasm
for resistance to rice yellow mottle virus, resistance to blast and
resistance to insect pests of upland rice in Africa, Sources of
resistance to these diseases and insect pests have been reported and
some are in the process of further confirmation (Alluri et al., 1982;
IITA annual reports for 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1982) .
About 2,500 accessions of 0. sativa and 1,500 accessions of
0. glaberrima have been characterized. The genetic resources
information was documented by computer at IITA (Ng, 1982b) .
Besides the standard characterization on morphology based on
the IBPGR/IRRI descriptors list, ORS7OW/IRA/IDESSA characterized
also the isozyme pattern of every accession studied and the pollen
fertility on hybrids of interspecific crosses. This information
is manually documented by recording in a logbook and by pub lishing
the reports.
WARDA had evaluated 1,103 accessions of rice germplasm for
resistance to iron toxicity and grain discoloration. It also
evaluated the germplasm for superior agronomic characteristics
under non-iron toxic conditions.

Genetic Resources Training
Most African nations lack trained manpower to work on
genetic resourd ces collection and conservation. Since 1980, two
plant exploration and conservation training course have been
conducted at IITA in collaboration with IBPGR and there will be
another one at ORSTOM. In collaboration with the IBPGR, a training
course on seed technology and genebank man agemen t will be held at
IITA in August, 1983.
Future Plans
1. Germplasm exploration and collection.
Most of the major rice growing countries in Africa had been
explored by IITA, IRAT/ORSTOW/IDESSA and WARDA during the past.
These count tries are: Benin Repub. lic, Cameroon, Chad, Egypt, Gambia,
Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Madagas car,
Malawi, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo
and Upper Volta. However, many remote country-sides of those
count tries have not been explored. There are also other countries,
such as Angola, Central Repub. lic of Africa, Congo, Mauritania,
Mauritius, Mozambique and Zaire from which rice germplasm have not
been collected.
IRAT/ORSTOM have done a good job in collecting wild species
of rice with the genome A in West Africa. However, further
exploratory surveys to tropical parts of Africa are needed to
ascertain the areas for intensive collection.



-10-
The first primary areas for future exploration appeared to
be: Angola, Niger, Madagas car, Upper Volta, Mozambique, and South
Sudan,
The second priority areas are: Central Republic of Africa,
Mali, Togo, Mauritius,
Tanzania, Zaire, Ghana, Cameroon
and Congo.
The third priority areas are: Mauritania, Gabon, Gambia and
Chad.
A joint effort of the African national, regional and.
int ternational institutes will be required to thoroughly explore the
germplasm of African rices for preservation and utilization.
Financial assistance will certainly be needed by the various
organizations operating in West Africa for further exploration.
ORSTOM/IRAT have proposed to explore Madagascar, Niger, southern
Sudan, Mali, Togo and also like to involve in exploration of wild
species in Asia in the next 5 years.
IITA will reduce the direct participation in rice germplasm
collections but will operate through the African national programs
in collaboration with IBPGR. IITA proposes to collaborate with
the national programs to collect rice germplasm in Chad, Niger,
Cameroon, Zaire, Upper Volta, Mauritius, Mozambique and the
Madagas car.
2. Characterization, evaluation, documen tation and
distribution.
ORSTOW/IBAF/IDESSA, IITA and WARDA will cont tinue to
characterize and document the germplasm of African rices and to



-11-
duplicate germplasm materials for storage at IITA and IRRI.
3. Seed germination and processing laboratory.
IITA and WARDA are in the process of equipping a seed
laboratory for routine seed germination test and for processing
seeds for storage.
4. Seed storage.
IITA plans to purchase and install an additional seed
store of size about 200 m3 to be operated at 5°C for storing the
working collection of rice.
