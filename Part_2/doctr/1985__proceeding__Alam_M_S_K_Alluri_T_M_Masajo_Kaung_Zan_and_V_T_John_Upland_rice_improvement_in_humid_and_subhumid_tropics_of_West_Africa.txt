IN HUMID AND SUBHUMID
TROPICS OF WEST AFRICA

The area (3.4%) and production (1.9%) of rice in Africa are small compared
with world figures. Fifty percent of the total African rice area is in West
Africa, which produces 35% of the continent's supply. In some countries
such as Sierra Leone and Liberia, the annual per capita consumption of rice
is 100 kg; in others it ranges from 15 to 22 kg. Populous countries such as
Nigeria import large amounts of rice to bridge the gap between supply and
demand. Rice is a strategically important crop in the food security system in
West African Countries.
IMPORTANCE OF UPLAND RICE
In Sub-Sahara Africa, upland rice is the most predominant growing system.
An estimated 2 million ha (50%) of the total rice area in Africa is grown as
upland rice (18). Upland rice is defined in this paper as "rice grown in
rainfed, naturally well-drained soils, without surface water accumulation,
normally without phreatic water supply, and normally not bunded" (14).
The West Africa Rice Development Association (19) classifies upland rice
cultivation into four groups: hill rice, flatland rice, upland rice cultivated
with use of ground water in addition to rain, and upland rice grown with use
of ground water only. Among these groups, flatland rice is the predominant
growing ecology and, along with hill rice, is situated in the moist forest zone
and the humid fringes of the savanna. In both ecologies, rice is cultivated
under slash-and-burn bush-fallow system and is often intercropped. Fields
are not bunded and direct seeding is practiced.
MAJOR CONSTRAINTS
Upland rice generally yields about 1 t/ha, depending on rainfall and
management. Major constraints are soil and climate, varieties, diseases and
insects, cultural practices, and socioeconomic conditions. This paper deals
with the first three.

236 PROGRESS IN UPLAND RICE RESEARCH
Soil
Upland rice soils in humid and subhumid tropics of Africa are fragile,
erosion prone, and low in water-holding capacity, organic matter content,
CEC, and nutrient status (especially N). In high-rainfall regions, acidity is
high and nutrient imbalances are frequently severe.
Climate
The quantity, distribution pattern, and reliability of rain are important
determinants of success of upland rice cultivation. In the humid zone where
rainfall is high, yields are limited by fungal diseases. Disease severity IS
increased by low light intensity caused by overcast skies.
Varieties
The tall and low-yielding traditional upland rice varieties are generally
panicle-weight type. They lodge when planted under high density and good
management with adequate soil moisture. However, most African upland
rice possess high levels of tolerance for drought, blast, and grain dis-
coloration.
Modern, semidwarf varieties perform unpredictably in upland condi-
tions. Research at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA)
shows that performance of semidwarf varieties in upland conditions is
variety specific and not a general plant characteristic (3, 10). Some
semidwarf varieties under favorable soil and moisture conditions and in the
absence of severe disease pressures have outperformed the traditional
varieties (10).
Diseases
Major diseases of upland rice are blast, leaf scald, grain discoloration, and
sheath blight. Drought aggravates but is not a prerequisite for blast (6).
Most improved introductions such as IR43, IR5931-110-1, and UPL Ri-5
with proven resistance to blast in Asia, have shown susceptibility under
upland conditions in West Africa. Leaf scald caused by Rhyncosporium
oryzae is widespread, particularly in humid areas, and it usually occurs late,
around flowering stage. Sheath blight caused by Thanatephorus cucumeris,
Frank Donk (Rhizoctonia solani) is particularly severe under high rainfall,
close planting, and high fertilization. Varieties with good levels of resistance
to this disease have yet to be identified.
The most common panicle disease in upland rice is grain discoloration or
dirty panicle. It is often caused by a group of fungal pathogens, among which
Sarocladium oryzae (Acrocylindrium oryzae) is the most dominant species
(16). Soil acidity, highly leached conditions and low CEC, and deficiency of
Ca, Mg, Zn, and Si have been reported to be implicated in the severity of this
syndrome (5).
Insect pests
More than 80 species of insects attack rice in West Africa but only about 13



UPLAND RICE IMPROVEMENT IN WEST AFRICA 237
are considered pests of major importance. Breniere (7) estimated that about
25% of rice yield losses are caused by insects in general. Stem borers,
particularly the pink borers (Sesamia calamistis and S. botanephaga ), are the
most important pests of upland rice in the humid tropics of West Africa. The
African specific white borer Maliarpha separatella is the most predominant
species, but because it does not cause deadhearts or white heads it causes
considerably less damage than the pink borer. Next in importance to the
pink borers are the grain-sucking bugs Aspavia armigera Fab. and Stenocoris
southwoodi.
BREEDING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
Upland rice improvement for the humid and subhumid zones of Africa aims
to develop improved varieties with high yield potential, good seedling and
vegetative vigor, intermediate plant stature, medium tillering ability,
maturity ranges of 95-140 d, acceptable grain quality, and sufficient levels of
tolerance for or resistance to various stresses.
The breeding approaches involve systematic evaluation of available
germplasm, introductions, generation of breeding materials and selection,
and an organized scheme of testing early as well as advanced breeding
materials to identify superior genotypes. Multilocational testing is a
combined effort between national programs, International Institute of
Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropi-
cales et des Cultures Vivrières (IRAT), International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI), and West Africa Rice Development Association
(WARDA). The major problem in Africa with high yield-potential intro-
ductions is their susceptibility to drought, blast, and grain discoloration.
The strategy for upland rice improvement has been to combine specific
adaptational attributes of local upland varieties with the yield potential of
unadapted introductions through appropriate hybridization programs
(crossing and intercrossing).
Drought resistance
Using a toposequence transect with life-saving sprinkler irrigation and
standard varieties at fixed intervals to study the drought line, several entries
were evaluated for drought resistance. Another field screening approach
used controlled sprinkler irrigation during the dry season to select superior
genotypes for drought tolerance and recovery. These approaches have
identified several superior lines (10, 11).
Deep-growing and thick roots are associated with drought resistance in
rice (4, 17). Root length is positively correlated with root thickness (8).
Selection for deep root systems at IITA is done by evaluating lines for root
thickness.
Among African varieties, LAC 23 has thick and deep roots and as such has
been a standard check variety for root system screening. LAC 23 was used as
the check for evaluating 500 upland rice accessions from IITA's Genetic



238 PROGRESS IN UPLAND RICE RESEARCH
Resources Unit (GRU) Tropical Oryza sativa (TOs) collections from the
humid regions of West Africa. Sixteen were distinctly superior to LAC 23 in
thick and deep root system (Table 1). Interestingly, 15 of these originated
from Liberia, from where the check LAC 23 was selected.
Multilocation testing
Entries in the advanced yield trial tested at four different sites in Nigeria
representing different ecological zones are shown in Table 2. The two high
yielding varieties ITA 305 and ITA 307 were derived from the cross TOx
936 (IR43/lguape Cateto). IR43 is an upland selection from IRRI while
Iguape Cateto is a drought-resistant upland variety with desirable root and
panicle characters.
ITA 305, selected specifically for high drought resistance, has shown
stability at higher yield level than 0S6 (Fig. 1).
Eight elite lines were tested at two locations in Nigeria, in Onne, situated
in humid forest ecology, and in Ilorin, representing a transitional zone near
savanna (Table 3). In 1983, the conditions in Ilorin were favorable, while at
Onne, the disease pressure was high.
Screening for acid upland
Upland soils in some high rainfall areas such as eastern Nigeria have high Al,
high acidity, and low P. Under severe nutritional imbalance in such areas,
several IITA lines have shown high tolerance. Results of this test are
reported elsewhere in this volume (2).

Resistance to insect pests
The strategy for insect control at IITA has been mainly through resistance
breeding. Resistance breeding success depends on suitable and reliable
screening techniques. At IITA, techniques for varietal screening have been
developed (12). A total of 1,296 lines for pink borer and 2,000 lines for white
borer have been evaluated. As a result, six entries (W1263, Taichung 16,
SML 81 B, Sikasso, DNJ146, and DNJ171) for pink borer and five entries
(TKM 6, ITA 6-4-2, ITA 7-7-2, IR 1168-76, and IR 1561-38-6-5) for white
borer have been identified as sources of resistance (1).
Superior grain quality
One objective of IITA's upland rice improvement program has been to
develop rice varieties with superior grain characteristics. This objective has
been realized in several elite upland lines (Table 4).
PROMISING SELECTIONS IN AFRICA
In tests with materials originating from diverse sources, several improved
lines have been found to be promising for African uplands (Table 5).

UPLAND RICE IMPROVEMENT IN WEST AFRICA 243
FUTURE EMPHASIS
Hybridization programs should be expanded to generate more and diverse
materials for the different upland rice-growing environments of Africa.
Such an expanded breeding program will have for its base improved and
adapted germplasm developed and selected from within Africa and will use
introduced varieties as possible donors of plant type, earliness, yield
potential, and better grain quality.
Mass-screening methods for drought resistance to allow for systematic
evaluation of all breeding lines are needed to ensure that only those with
acceptable tolerance levels are kept. Selection for genotypes with a deep and
thick root system in the early segregating generations should be continued.
To hasten identification of breeding lines with durable resistance,
screening for blast must be done at key sites within the major rice-growing
regions. Such a multilocational testing scheme would also yield information
on differences in virulence of the blast pathogen in the key production areas.
Studies of grain discoloration, sheath blight, and leaf scald diseases should
be conducted and be the basis of practical screening methodologies to
support the breeding program. Efforts to obtain quantitative figures on crop
losses due to stem borers and grain-sucking bugs must be emphasized.
Studies on how to develop suitable screening techniques for grain-sucking
bugs (Aspavia armigera and Stenocoris sourhwoodi) must be started and stem
borer screening given more emphasis.
Collaboration among national, regional, and international programs to
promote better interaction among rice scientists and assist in the exchange of
rice germplasm and information is essential to more rapid growth of rice
varietal improvement work in Africa.
