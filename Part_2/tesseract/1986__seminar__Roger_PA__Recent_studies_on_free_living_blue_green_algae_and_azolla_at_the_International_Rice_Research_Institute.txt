AZOLLA AT THE INTERNATIONAL RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE

P.A. ROGER’ and I. WATANABE
The International Rice Research Institute
Los Bafios, Laguna, Philippines

Semmary. Major findings in 1985-86 at the International Rice Research Institute (IRR1) on
‘+ ecology and practical utilization of free-living and symbiotic blue-green algae (BGA) are
summarized. They cover the chemical composition of cultures and natural samples of N2fixing BGA from rice fields ; abundance of heterocystous BGA in rice soils and soil-based
inocula ; dynamics of algal populations and acetylene reducing activity in soils inoculated with .
BGA ; soil properties and Azolla growth ; Azoila response to P.K. Zn in various soils in relation
’ to floodwater chemistry ; Azolia insect pests ; and availability of Azolla N to rice.

- During the last 10 years, IRRI has initiated a dynamic research program in

the field of biofertilizers and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). The goal is to obtain

_ good rice yields with the lowest possible use of chemical N fertilizer by utilizing N2fixing organisms and farm-grown source of nutrients. The objectives are :
@ to collect, identify, and conserve N2-fizing organisms from rice soils ;

'@ to determine N fixed by these organisms and the factors influencing their activity;
¢ to develop methods and cultural practices enhancing BNF in rice fields ;

'- @ to establish with scientists from selected countries a cooperative research
network on BNF in rice fields ; and

® to train scientists who can strengthen the national capabilities for conducting
research on BNF.

Recent reviews by IRRI authors summarize the current status of knowledge
and practical utilization of BNF in rice fields (Watanabe and Roger, 1984; Watanabe,
1985; Roger and Watanabe, 1986).

BNF research programs at IRRI are supported by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP). Results are extended to national research systems
through the International Network for Soil Fertility and Fertilizer Evaluation for

_ Rice {INSFFER), supported by the Government of Switzerland.

RESEARCH ON FREE-LIVING BLUE-GREEN ALGAE.

Agronomic interest in BGA'started in the 1930s when De attributed the high
spontaneous fertility of submerged rice soils to BGA. Since then, BGA has been
cited as'a° “promising potential source of nitrogen for rice", many trials of algal
inoculation have been conducted in rice growing countries, and inoculation of rice
fields with BGA’ has been recommended (Venkataraman, 1981). In 1986, BGA is
still-only “promising”, and the only technology proposed to farmers (aigalization) is

conducted on a “trial and error” basis and not utilized to a noticeable extent.
Despite 50 years of research on BGA, our knowledge of their practical utilisation
has made relatively little progress because of these major reasons

research projects on BGA sought the practical utilisation of BGA, ecological and

experiments - Most experiments give no information on the environiiental
characteristics, the initial level of indigenous N2-fixring BGA in the soil, the
dynamics of the algal flora during the crop cycle, the fate of inoculated BGA, their
influence on BNF and other factors involved in the yield increase. Therefore, little
is known about the factors that permit the development of a bloom of indigenous
or inoculated BGA in a field.

, erestimation of the potential of indigenous strains : Till recently,
almost ali studies have placed emphasis on inoculation with foreign strains
selected in the laboratory. Little attention was given to indigenous strains (already
adapted to the environmental conditions), agricultural practices that favor their
growth, and integrated management.

Therefore, the BGA research program at IRRI has given priority to field
studies with emphasis on the occurrence of BGA in rice soils, their composition and
biomass, composition of BGA inocula, fate af inoculated BGA, changes in BGA
populations and N2-fixing activity in inoculated soils, and agricultural practices
favoring BGA growth. Major results obtained during the last two years are
summarized thereafter. Earlier studies had been summarized (Roger and
Watanabe, 1982)

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF CULTURES AND NATURAL SAMPLES OF N2FIXING BGA FROM RICE FIELDS { Roger et al 1985, Roger et al 1986)

Seventy samples of N2-fixing BGA 1) grown in liquid medium in the
laboratory, 2) grown on soil in a greenhouse, and 3} collected from rice fields, were
studied.

Dry matter content averaged 4 %. A Arschere//a sp. showed the highest value
(13%). The lowest values (< 1 %} were recorded for genera forming mucilaginous
colonies ( Gloeotrichia , Aphanothece, Nostoc). High variability of dry matter
content (CV = 50 to 80%) was due partly to the nature of the strain (mucilaginous
BGA have less dry matter than nonmucilaginous ones). However, high variability
was also observed between species of the same genus (Anmebazena : 1.0 to 8.5%;
Nostoc : 0.28 to 6.3 % ).

Ash content of laboratory cultures averaged 7.4% of the dry weight, that of |
field samples averaged 45%, ranging from 27 to 71%.

Nitrogen content, on ash-free basis, ranged from 1.9 to ii.8% (average 6%).
Intrageneric variability was large( CV = 20 to 42% ). N and pigment contents
decreased in aging material.

Phosphorus and N contents were positively correlated. At P contents
higher than 1% there was no more increase in N content. The optimal value of 1%
was attained in laboratory cultures only. Soil-grown BGA and natural samples had
concentrations lower than 0.5%, confirming that P availability limits BGA growth
in natural environments.

Potassium content of the ash-free algal material collected from the field
(average: 0.5%) was similar to that of faboratory cultures, which indicates that K
availability probabiy does not limit BGA growth.

Muitivariate analysis showed that physiological state is at least as important
as the nature of the strain in explaining the variability of the composition.

The wide range of dry matter (0.9-7 %) and ash (27-71%) contents in field
samples shows thal the weight of a bloom of BGA gives little information about its
agronomic significance. Average and extreme values of dry matter, ash, and N
contents of field samples show that N content in | ton of fresh N2-fixing BGA
averages 1.1 kg but may vary from 0.3 to 3.8 kg.

Algal biomass in rice fields range from a few kilograms to $8 tons fresh
weight/ha or 500 kg dry weight. N2-fixing algal biomasses range within the same
limits (Roger and Kulasooriya, 1980; Roger, 1986). Assuming a maximum biomass of
500 kg dry weight/ha and using average ash and N values obtained for artificial
blooms and field samples, the potential contribution of a BGA bloom is 14 kg N/ha.

CN values of 4.8-13 show better N availability from BGA than from
farmyard and green manures. Tirol et al. (1982) showed that N availability from
BGA to two successive rice crops was similar to that of ammonium sulfate.

ABUNDANCE OF HETEROCYSTOUS BGA IN RICE SOILS AND SOIL-BASED
INOCULA. ( Roger et al., in press a,b)

Heterocystous BGA in rice soils. The quantitative study of the algal population
in 102 rice soils from 5 countries showed Nz2-fixing strains in all samples.
Heterocystous BGA comprised, on the average, 9% of the total algal population.
Their density ranged from 1 x 102 to 8 x 106 CFU/cm? ( median 6 x 104), was
higher than 103 CFU/cm? in 95% of the samples, and was positively correlated with
soil pH and available P.

Nostoc was recorded in 99% of the samples and was the dominant N2-fixing
genus in 74 % of them. Genera that form mucilaginous colonies (Mostoc ,
Aphanothece ) and ate less susceptible to grazing (Grant ef 2/1985) were dominant
in more than 90% of the soils: strains that do not form mucilaginous colonies
(Anabaena Cafothriz, and Fischerel/a) were present in most soils but were rarely

dominant. This may indicate that grazing is a major limiting factor in the
development of blooms of nonmucilaginous strains active in N2-fixation.

No significant correlation was observed between the relative abundance of

the various groups of heterocystous BGA and soil physicochemical properties.

Analysis of soil-based inocuia. Algae were enumerated in 22 samples of soilbased inocula (SBI) collected from Burma, Egypt, and India and produced at IRRI.
Densities of heterocystous BGA ranged from 5 x 104 to 3 x 10? CFU/g dry weight.
Average values in multisirain and monostrain SBI were similar (2-3 x 106 CFU/g
dry weight) and about 100 times lower than in dried laboratory cultures (2 x 108
CFU/g dry weight).
The relative abundance of N2-fixing BGA in SB] was low, ranging from 3 t

32% (average 15 %). Among N2-fixing strains, Mosfoc spp. were clearly dominant, |

comprising an average 73% of the CFU. The two most abundant heterocystous
strains in a given inoculum accounted for an average 95% of the total counts of
heterocystous BGA, showing that multistrain SB] were rather unbalanced with
regard to the relative abundance of the various strains.

Chemical analysis showed 78-86% ash (average 80.6%) , 2.1-4.7% C (average
3.4%) , 0.2-0.8 % N (average 0.5%), and 640-1900 ppm P, indicating that SBI
contained mostly soil and only about 1% of BGA material.

Ratio between inoculated and indigenous BGA. The average density of
heterocystous BGA in SBI was 2 x 106 CFU /g dry weight. Applying the
recommended dose of 10 kg/ha ( Venkataraman ,1981) of this inoculum brings 2 x
10!1 CFU/ha or 2 x 103 CFU/cm2. This is 150 times less than the average density of
indigenous N2-fixing BGA in the soils examined (3 x 105 CFU/cm2) . The study of
the ratio of indigenous heterocystous BGA from 102 soils to inoculated
heterocystous BGA from 22 SBI showed that in 90% of the cases, indigenous BGA
in the first centimeter of soil of a one-hectare rice field were more abundant than
BGA brought by 10 kg of algal inoculum. In about 50% of the cases, the ratio of
indigenous heterocystous BGA to inoculated BGA was higher than 100.

Discussion. The study showed that multispecies SBI are unbalanced : one or two
Strains, mostly the Mosfoc spp. dominate. A suitable method for producing a
balanced multistrain inoculum of known quality would be to produce monospecific
inocula of various strains, evaluate their concentration in CFU after drying and mix
them accordingly.

All studied rice soils had heterocystous BGA. In most cases, the
heterocystous BGA in the quantity of SB] recommended for application were less
numerous than indigenous ones on a unit-area basis. Despite that, inoculation was
reportedly successful in soils which, according to our results, contained a fairly high
level of indigenous heterocvstous BGA. Among other possible explanations, such a

success might be attributed to the accumulation of P by propagules of BGA
inoculum (produced with high levels of P), which gives them an initial advantage
for growth over the propagules of most often P-deficient indigenous BGA (Roger ¢2
a/, 1986). Since spore germination is photodependent ( Reddy, 1984), inoculated
propagules applied on soil surface might have better germination than the
indigenous propagules mixed with the soil. However, such hypothesis need to be
demonstrated as well as other possible ones not related to BNF.

DYNAMICS OF ALGAL POPULATIONS AND ACETYLENE REDUCING
ACTIVITY IN SOILS INOCULATED WITH BGA (Reddy and Roger, in press)

The dynamics of inoculated strains of heterocystous BGA and indigenous
' algae were studied for one month in 1-m?2 microplots of five soils previousiy airdried or oven-dried at 110 9C. Oven drying was performed to assess whether a
reduction of the indigenous algal population favors the establishment of inoculated
- BGA. Inoculum was a mixture of dry SBI containing nonindigenous Azbeena
| vartabilis, Talypothrix tenuis, Aulosira fertilissima, Fischerelia 3p., and Nostoc sp.,
spread at 20 kg /ha. The same soils were then dried and resubmerged for two
months to study the effect of controlling algal grazers (a major limiting factor for
BGA) with neem (Azadirachta indica ) seeds on the revival and dynamics of
indigenous and inoculated algae. ARA was measured and algal populations were
enumerated for four weeks as in the first experiment. Then soils were kept flooded
for another month and the nature and biomass of algae were then determined.

Heat treatment markedly reduced algal populations. Survival in the soils, ranged
from 4 to 17%. Eukaryotic algae and unicellular BGA were the most affected.
Heterocystous BGA were more resistant.

Dynamics of algal populations were similar in air-dried and oven-dried
treatments of a given soil during the month following inoculation . Heterocystous
BGA populations exhibited poor growth in soils richer in organic matter. In other
soils, they comprised a significant percentage of the total algal population and
"became dominant by the 14th day of submersion in two soils. In most cases,
. indigenous heterocystous BGA were more numerous than inoculated ones. The
ratio of CFU of indigenous to inoculated heterocystous BGA ranged from 0.1 to 840
' (average 104). Only on 7 out of 40 occasions were inoculated BGA more numerous
than indigenous heterocystous BGA. This was observed with no growth or late
growth of indigenous heterocystous BGA , or after the decline of a bloom of
indigenous heterocystous BGA.

"Once the soils were dried, two inoculated strains disappeared. During the first
month following rewetting, heterocystous BGA growth was poor in all soils but
better in neem-treated plots than in the controls. Indigenous strains were usually
more abundant than inoculated ones. Only on 4 out of 40 occasions did inoculated

heterocystous BGA become more abundant than the indigenous ones. This was |
observed only after the decline of the indigenous populations of heterocystous BGA."

Establishment of inoculated algae. Counts of inoculated BGA showed no clear
effect of oven-drying of soil or neem application on the establishment of inoculated
BGA. But strains markedly differed in ability to persist in the soils. 7 zenu/s was
the most abundant inoculated strain in 65% of the cases. Despite a low level of
inoculation, A. /erdii/ssima developed and persisted during the second experiment.
A. vVariabilis and Nostoc SL significantly multiplied during the first experiment but
disappeared during the second. 
Acetylene-reducing activity (ARA) was, on the average, higher in air-dried and
in neem-treated plots than in oven-dried and non neem-treated plots. ARA was
correlated with the counts of total heterocystous BGA and indigenous heterocystous
BGA but not with the counts of inoculated BGA. This indicated that ARA was
principally due to indigenous BGA. However, correlation coefficients were generally
higher with total heterocystous BGA than with indigenous heterocystous BGA, .which may indicate some contribution by inoculated BGA. © .
BGA biomass after two months of submersion Was higher in neem-treated
plots. in 35 of 40 cases, indigenous strains of algae became’ dominant. However,
inoculated A/ertilissima developed in two neem-treated soils and became
dominant in one where it produced a bloom corresponding to 450 kg ‘dry
weight/ha (35 kg N/ha), the highest biomass recorded in a plot during pus

Discussion. The longer persistence of some of ‘the strains and the late
establishment of blooms of inoculated A. feriidissima in ‘plots of two’ soils treated
with neem, where this strain developed the highest BGA biomass in the experiment,
might indicate some potentia! for foreign strain inoculation-in rice soils. However
establishment of inoculated nonindigenous strains was infrequent in the studied
soils. This agrees with the results of Grant et al. (1985), showing the. failure ‘of
nonindigenous inoculated BGA to establish in the field, even’ when grazers: were)
controlled. The results also confirmed the beneficial effect of neem application . on,

RESEARCH ON AZOLLA 4

Whereas BGA technology is more at an experimental level of large: ‘field
testing, Azo//e technology has been used for several centuries in China “and
Vietnam. In these countries, however, environmental and economical. constraints
limited Azol/a use to about 2 x 106 ha in 1983 (Roger and Watanabe, 1986). Use of |
Azoila as green manure in China and Vietnam is decreasing, but interest in its use !

as fish and anima! feed, mineral scavenger, and depollutant has increased
(Liuchungchu, 1984). In other parts of Asia, Azo//a technology is not beyond smallscale trials except in South Cotabato (Philippines). In this area, high available P,
9-11 months of rainy. season, well-irrigated rice fields, and the presence of many
small ponds allowed wide adoption of A pinaata which was then replaced by a
more efficient strain of 4. a/crophylla ( Watanabe,198 4).

Under optimum conditions (22 °C), maximum biomass is 100 kg N /ha for A.
pinnata, 140 kg N/hafor A. Aicu/oides , (Watanabe and Berja, 1983), and 190 kg
N/ha for A. avcropAy//a (Watanabe, 1986). In INSFFER trials average productivity
per Azol/fa crop was 1.5 kg/m? ( about 30 kg N/ha ) before transplanting and 1.1
kg /m2 after transplanting (Watanabe in press). At IRRI, the maximum biomass
was 80 kg N /ha for A. avcrophyl/ain 28 days (Watanabe, in press). Productivity
discrepancy under optimum and field conditions is due to many constraints in the
field. Technical constraints in the tropics are as follows :

4 1) Low temperature requirement. Optimum temperature for most species is
below the average temperature in the tropics. Cool weather is a key to successful
Azoffa cultivation in Vietnam and China. High temperature and humidity result in
high pests incidence.

2) Need for P fertilizer. P is the most important nutrient (Watanabe et al,
1986)

. 3} Insect damage. Insect control is an important economic limitation. If more
than 200 g carbofuran ai/ha is needed to control insects, benefits are eliminated
{Kikuchi et al ,1984).

4) Year-round maintenance of inoculum. Because Azoé/a is multiplied
vegetatively, inoculum must be maintained in nurseries all year and multiplied for
distribution before field cultivation.

5) Need for good water control.

Research at IRRI has placed emphasis on resistance to adverse temperatures,
soil and nutritional requirements, insect pests, and availability of Azol/a N to rice .

Azoffa doubling time was less than 3.5 days ; moderately suitable with a doubling
time of 3.5 to 5.0 days; and nonsuitable with a doubling time longer than 5 days.
Doubling time was less than 5 days in 40% of the samples growing under full
sunlight and 34% of those growing in the shade. It was less than 3.5 days in 13% of
the samples in full sunlight and 8% of those growing in the shade. Without P
fertilisation, only limited areas have soils suitable for Azo//@ growth .

Soil available P and Azolf/a gtowth (Watanabe and Ramirez, 1984). The
productivity, N content, and P content of Azo//a grown on 29 soils from 4
Philippine sites were studied with regard to the soil available P and P sorption
capacity. Using simultaneously data on available P and P sorption capacity, it was
possible to calculate a discriminate function separating soils according to their
Azolfa productivity. Results showed that A. punneta grows satisfactorily without P
application in soils with Olsen P values higher than 30 mg/kg and P sorption
capacity lower than 1500 mg P205/100 g. Such conditions are rare in rice soils and’
P fertilization for Azo/a growth usually is needed. None of the other analyzed soil
properties (total C, total N, and exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg) correlated with Azo//a
productivity.

AZOLLA RESPONSE TO P, £, AND Zn IN VARIOUS SOILS, IN RELATION TO
FLOODW ATER CHEMISTRY (Ali and Watanabe, 1986)

The supply of P,K, andZn to Azoé/a from flooded soils and the kinetics of P,
K, and Zn in floodwater were studied in pots, using 11 Philippine rice soils, ranging
from loamy sand to ciay (pH range : 4.7 - 7.7). Treatments were a control ( no
fertilization), PK, KZn, PZn, and PKZn applied just before Azoé/a inoculation. Azo//s
was harvested 3 weeks after inoculation.

Phosphorus concentration in the floodwater of P fertilized soils decreased
tapidly and became similar to that in the control within a week. Phosphate in
floodwater 1 week after Azoé/@ inoculation was correlated with soil Olsen P (r =
0.83}, except for one soil. Phosphate application did not increase P content in Azo//2
at harvest. The K and Zn contents of Azo//a at harvest increased with K and Zn
application. In two soils, Azo//e biomass was lower in the treatments without K or
Zn than in the PKZn treatment, but Azo//a analysis showed no K or Zn deficiency.

Azol/a biomass ranged from 9 to 53 g dry weight/m2 and N content from |
2.1 to 5.2%. Azole N was highly correlated with dry weight (r - 0.953). Dry
weight and N were highly correlated with P content (r = 0.63-0.55), but not with K
of Zn, indicating that P supply limited Azof/g@ growth. The critical level of P in
Azolfa was about 0.15%. Floodwater P was better correlated with Azaf/a P (r =
0.739) one week after Azo//a inoculation than at 2 or 3 weeks. When floodwater
P at 1 week was less than 0.1 ppm, AZo//a was P deficient. When floodwater P was _,
more than 0.4 ppm, P supply to Azo//a was sufficient.

PHOSPHATE APPLICATION

Surveys of N and P contents in field-grown Aza//a showed a threshold value
of P deficiency of 0.4% P in Azod/a (dry weight basis). When Azo//a P was higher
than 0.4%, N content was about 4% dry weight (Watanabe and Ramirez, 1984: Ali
and Watanabe, 1986). About 80% of Azoé/a samples collected from fields and
ponds in the Philippines had less than 0.4% P and 4% N (unpublished). Application
of P can increase Azo//a growth under economically feasible conditions, especially
split application of superphosphate which can increase N gains of Azo//a by 4.6 g
N/g P (Watanabe et al, 1980). Recent datafrom A ancrophyila showed 10 g N/g P
(unpublished).

Application of P to the inoculum permits its multiplication without P
application in the main field until it becomes deficient (P<0.2%). P-enriched
inoculum may be used for rapidly producing a large Azaé/e biomass (unpublished).

EFFECY OF N FERTILIZER

in the absence of competing organisms, BNF by Azov/@ is more tolerant of
combined N than that by free-living microorganisms. Azolla ARA was reduced by
about 50% by 10 mM urea-N or ammonium-N and 25 mM of nitrate-N, whereas a
24-hr exposure to [mM ammonium-N completely repressed ARA in free-living BGA
{Ito and Watanabe, 1983). /a stu however, competing aquatic plants growing at the
erpense of foodwater N, may hinder Azo//e growth. In the presence of green algae,
1.4 mM ammonium -N inhibited A. pinnata growth by 60% (Watanabe et al., 1977).

The Azaf/fa canopy prevents light from penetrating the floodwater, inhibits
the growth of other phototrophs, and depresses photodependent CO2 uptake. Thus,
the floodwater pH is lower than in Azo//efree conditions. Azo//a may therefore be
expected to reduce N losses by ammonia volatilization.

Using the delta '5N technique and Zemze minor as non N2-fizing control, the
contribution of BNF to N of A.avcrophy//a grown on two soils was estimated to be
70-100% (Yoneyama et ai, in press).

AZOLLA INSECT PESTS (Mochida et al. in press)

Five Diptera ( Casranomus crassiforceps, C javanus, C kitensis, Polypedilum
anticum and P suturalis/, one Coleoptera ( Nanophyes sp.), and four Lepidoptera
{ Ephestiopsis vishnu |webworm] and three species of A/opAi/a (caseworms} were
recorded as Azo//@ pests in the Philippines. The life cycle of the webworm and
three caseworms were studied, and their populations were ‘monitored at IRRI
using light traps and counts on 4. aricrophyi/la and A. pmnata. At 27 %C, Alophila
life cycle is about 31-32 days and 4péestiopsis , about 20 days. The standing

anucrophylfa and 135/m2 on A. pinneta. Caseworm populations on the same strains
averaged 57 and 48/m2_ respectively. Azo//a yield loss due to these insects ranged
from 6 to 64 % for 4. microphylla and from 13 to 57% for A. pinnata Although
pesticide application was effective for controlling insect pesis, no method is yet
economically feasible.

AVAILABILITY OF AZOLLA NITROGEN TO RICE (ito and Watanabe, 1985)

Decomposition of Azo//e in water and soil in relation to the availability of
Azo#fa N to rice plants was determined using '5N as a tracer. When Azo//a was
placed on the surface of flooded soils, about 66% of its N was lost within 6 weeks.
Losses were about 30% when Azo//a was incorporated. Rice plants grown in a pot
absorbed 50% of N from Azoé//a incorporated at transplanting and less than 10% of
N from Azoffa kept on the water surface. In the field, N availability from
incorporated Azo//e was higher than that from AzZaé/a placed at the soil surface.
However, N availability from incorporated Azolla (12-27%) was much lower than
that in a pot. With late application, 78 days after transplanting, Azo//e
contribution to grain N was higher than with application 30 or 53 days after
transplanting.

BIOFERTILIZER GERMPLASM

As part of its BNF program, IRRI has collected a large germplasm of N2-firing
organisms, and currently acts as an international center for Azoé//e germplasm
collection and distribution. IRRI maintains the largest collection of Azof/a (168
strains from 7 species and 4 Aabaenafree species) and of blue-green algae (
about 200 strains ) isolated from rice fields. A large number of N2-fixing bacteria
are also preserved. Hundred of sirains of these organisms have been given to
iaboratories all over the world.

CONCLUSION

Studies on BGA show the presence of indigenous strains in all soiis, and the
usuai poor establishment of inoculated foreign strains. Attention should therefore
be given to agriculturai practices that enhance the growth of indigenous strains
which are already adapted to the environmental conditions and can also be utilized
for producing inocula. Studies on Azolla confirm that P is a key factor. Insecticide
and P application to an inocuium of a selected strain might be an economical
management, permitting Azolla multiplication in the field without further P and
insecticide application.
