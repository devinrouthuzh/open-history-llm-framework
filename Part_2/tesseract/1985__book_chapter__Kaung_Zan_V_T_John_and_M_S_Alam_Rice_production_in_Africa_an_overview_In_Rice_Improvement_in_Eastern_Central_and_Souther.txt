RICE PRODUCTION IN AFRICA:
AN OVERVIEW
KAUNG ZAN, V.T. JOHN, AND M.S. ALAM

INTRODUCTION

Rice production in Africa has been engaging the attention of national and
international agricultural policy makers recently. Rice is a strategic component of
food security and a crucial element in the staple food economies of several
African countries. Demand for rice in Sub-Saharan Africa is becoming more
acute as a result of a general dietary shift from traditional foods, and this demand
will likely continue to rise. Production must be stepped up to avert a serious
economic drain of the foreign exchange reserves in most countries.

In 1982, Africa had about 3.5% of the world's total rice area and nearly 2.2% of
total production. The ecologies under which rice is cultivated vary considerably.
About 50% of the area is classified as upland, in many respects unfavorable for rice
production. The remainder is subjected to varied water regimes and nutrient
imbalances. Only 11% of the entire area is irrigated. Production needs to be
increased in 89% of the total rice area if self-sufficiency is to be achieved.

Toward this goal, the World Bank loaned the various rice projects in Africa
US$199 million (12) in 1982. The 1985 total estimated land-use for rice in Africa is
5.7 million ha. The estimate for 1990 is 6.8 million ha. During the next 15 yr, an
additional 3 million ha are expected to be placed under irrigation, half of which will
be in northern Africa. Sahelian, western, and eastern and southern Africa will each
bring 500 000 ha under assured irrigation (13). If these goals are met, the import
bills of most African countries will be reduced considerably, if not eliminated.

RICE SITUATION IN AFRICA

Rice area
The total rice area in Africa between 1961 -65 and 1982 is given in Table 1. The
regional patterns for 1970, 1975, and 1980 are given in Table 2.

Rice area increased 62.7% from 1961-65 to 1982. West African rice land forms
nearly 50% of the entire rice area in Africa and shows a 28% increase from 1970 to
1980. On the other hand, the northern region shows a 15% decrease while central,

east, and southern Africa show an 11% increase over 1970. Table 3 shows the rice
area in 15 major rice-growing countries (out of a total of 31) in Africa during 1970
and 1980. Summarizing the trends, Table 4 lists countries which have increased
their rice area, countries with no change in rice area, and those with decreased
area.

Out of 31 countries listed, 18 increased in rice area from 1970 to 1980 with a total
area of 3 789 000 ha in 1980. Substantial increase in area has been noted in Ivory
Coast, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Malagasy. Seven countries with a total area of
1 011 000 ha in 1980 decreased area; prominent among these were Guinea and
Egypt. Six countries with a total area of 75 000 ha did not show any change.

Production
Rice production in Africa increased steadily from 1961-65 to 1982, paralleling the
world trend. Compared with the 1961-65 figure for Africa, the production level for
1982 was 64.6% higher. Table 5 summarizes rice production trends in Africa
between 1961-65 and 1982, and Table 6 gives rice production by regions.

The increase in production of rice in Africa from 1970 to 1980 was contributed by
two regions - West Africa and central and eastern Africa. On the other hand, the

decreased production of northern Africa is symbolized by the drastic fall in
hectarage of rice land in Egypt (Table 3). Table 7 shows the productivity level of
rice and the total production in 15 major rice-growing countries.

The per hectare yields in the major rice-growing countries in tropical Africa,
excluding Egypt, generally remained low from 1969-71 to 1980. The low yields are a
serious constraint. The major reason for the increase in total rice production in
Africa is the increase in area under cultivation, pointing to the need to increase the
per hectare yields in individual countries.

Based on the per hectare productivity recorded in 1970 and 1980, Table 8
summarizes each country's production trend over the 10-yr period. Fourteen
countries show an increase in per hectare yields of rice, whereas II countries show
a decrease and 5 no change.

Second only to Far Eastern countries, Africa is the worlds major importer of rice.
However, unlike the Far East, Africa steadily increased importation of rice between
1979 and 1982 (Table 10).

Although the main rice exporting country in Africa is Egypt, the quantity
exported from that country has steadily decreased from 178 000 t in 1976-78 to
25 000 t in 1982 (12). The major rice importing countries are listed in Table II.

Table II shows the almost constant or sometimes increasing trends in rice
imports in several ricegrowing countries of Africa. The increased demand for
importation stems from the fact that the self-sufficiency level, as reflected in
WARDA countries, has been decreased while the per capita consumption has
been increased (Table 12).

While the local supply for consumption has remained at about 1.5 million t in the
WARDA countries, the per capita consumption has increased since 1975 and,
probably as a result of increased population, has led to higher import levels and
lowered self-sufficiency.

PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF RICE PRODUCTION

Systems of rice culture

Experts attending conferences and workshops on systems of rice culture in Africa
have generally agreed that ricegrowing systems (ecosystems) in the region
should be grouped as follows:

Â¢ Dryland rice (upland rice) is grown on naturally freely-drained soils, where

the water table is always below the rice roots. Therefore, the moisture supply is
entirely dependent on rainfall.

Â¢ Hydromorphic rice (rainfed lowland rice) is grown on the soils where rice

roots are periodically saturated by a fluctuating water table, in addition to
rainfall.

Â¢ Mangrove swamp rice (tidal swamp rice) is grown in swamps along the

coastal regions with tidal intrusion.

Â¢ Inland swamp rice (rainfed medium-deep waterlogged rice) is grown on flat

or V-shaped valley bottoms and flooded to different degrees, which sometimes leads to floating conditions.

Â¢ Paddy rice (irrigated rice) is grown on bunded paddies, either under rainfed

or irrigated conditions.

Although reliable statistics on areas under different ecosystems are difficult to
obtain, reasonable estimates have been made for West Africa. Dryland and
hydromorphic rice systems have been combined under the upland rice category,
and the remaining three (mangrove, inland swamp, and paddy) make up the
lowland rice category (25). Recent estimates of area in upland, lowland rainfed,
deep water, and irrigated ecologies for all of Sub-Sahara Africa are listed in
Table 13. In this classification also, hydromorphic rice is combined with the true
upland rice ecology.

Climatic resources and constraints

Climatic factors, such as rainfall, temperature, solar radiation, and photoperiod,
influence the physiological expression of the genetic potential of rice varieties.
Climate also influences the incidence of pests and diseases, which in turn reduce
grain yields.

including hydromorphic phreatic rice, considered upland in Senegal.

Rainfall is crucial to successful rainfed rice cultivation. The quantity, reliability,
duration. and frequency of rains affect the suitability of the area and also attainable
yields. In the high rainfall humid zone of West Africa, where upland rice is grown
extensively, drought is not a major problem. Other areas have low mean annual
precipitation and or unreliable rainfall, so moisture supply becomes the most
limiting factor for upland rice. This is especially true in transition and savanna
regions of West Africa and also in rainfed rice areas of central and eastern Africa,
such as Tanzania and Malagasy. In addition, most upland rice soils, especially in
West Africa, have low water-holding capacity. This, coupled with the relatively
shallow-rooting habit of the rice plant, limits the soil volume the plant exploits for
moisture (3). This situation justifies breeding rice varieties for drought resistance.

Rainfall patterns in major parts of central Africa, such as Angola, Cameroon,
Gabon, and Zaire, are more favorable for rice production. Yet. the full potential of
rainfed rice production in these countries remains to be fully assessed, including
the social factors and food preferences.

Temperature greatly influences the growth pattern, duration. and yield of rice.
Critical temperatures for different growth stages of the rice plant have been
identified (Table 14). Air temperatures normally below 20Â°C and above 30Â°C
markedly affect the growth and yield of rice (27). The mean minimum
temperatures in several rice areas of central and eastern Africa and Malagasy drop
below 25 C and at times much lower during the rice-growing season.

Two types of cold, cold weather and cold water, can injure rice. The common
symptoms caused by low temperature are: poor germination, slow growth and
discoloration of seedlings, stunted vegetative growth, delayed heading and
incomplete panicle exsertion, prolonged flowering period because of irregular
heading, degeneration of spikelets, sterility, and formation of abnormal grains (15).
Delay in flowering and delayed maturity duration are especially marked in MV. For
example, the growth duration of IRAT8 and IRAT13 is extended to about 160 d in
cold-prone Rwanda, whereas they mature in 120-130 d in various parts of West
Africa.

The effect of high temperature is more pronounced at the heading stage when
the fertility of spikelets is adversely affected by temperatures above 35Â°C, as in
Sahelian countries.

Solar radiation in the tropics is higher in the DS than in the WS. Consequently,
the DS yield is higher. Low solar radiation. particularly during the reproductive
stage, can greatly reduce spikelet number. During the ripening stage, it reduces
grain yield by decreasing the percentage of filled spikelets.

During August, usually coincidental with the critical reproductive stage in
rainfed rice in the forest belt of West Africa, low solar radiation lessens chance of
obtaining high yield (22). Under good water and fertilizer management, as with
irrigated rice, too little light can easily limits yeilds in the humid zone of Africa.

Soil resources and constraints

The world's most productive rice land consists mostly of young alluvial soils in
river deltas and inland valleys. Soils in such rice areas are predominantly
hydromorphic. Entisols and Inceptisols are of fine medium texture with montmorillonitic and vermiculitic clay mineralogy. The reserve of nutrients of these
soils and their ability to supply them are generally high because of their high cation
exchange capacity and weatherable mineral contents. The distribution of such
fertile land in the wetter regions of tropical Africa is limited, thus limiting any rapid
expansion of rice production there. According to FAO (9), the total area of
Aquepts and Aquents in tropical Africa is estimated at about 55 and 48 million ha
in the forest and savanna, respectively.

Well-drained upland soils. The well-weathered Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols in
the tropical wet-dry region are marginally suitable for upland rice because of their
low available water-holding capacity, resulting from a sandy surface horizon and
kaolinitic mineralogy. On such soils, even relatively short dry spells hurt upland
rice. Hence, the performance of upland rice on such soils depends largely on
available soil moisture reserve and tolerance of the rice variety to drought stress.

Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting plant nutrient for upland rice. The behavior of
available N in soils with a seasonally fluctuating ground-water table may cause
severe N deficiency. This is particularly true in soils situated at the intermediate
zone between the weli-drained and wetter parts at the lower relief on a rolling and
undulating topography.
16 RICEIMPROVEMENT IN EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND SOUTHERN AFRICA

Phosphorus and sulfur deficiencies have been observed in rainfed upland
rice grown in the savanna. On Alfisols in the dry-wet region, with continuous
cultivation or after burning following land clearing, iron (Fe) deficiency may be
observed.

Leaching losses, soil acidity, and multiple nutrient deficiencies in high rainfall
regions may severely hurt yields on strongly leached Ultisols and Oxisols. This is
particularly true for high-yielding rice varieties with high nutrient demand.

Hydromorphic and swamp soils. In the Precambrian basement complex
areas of West Africa, the rolling topography has small V-shaped or U-shaped
valleys. In such valleys the quality of interflow spring or seepage water is important.
During most of the year, seepage water contains a high level of Fe** and Mn*
ions. Hence, Fe toxicity in rice grown in the inland valleys or swamps is common,
especially in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. The terrain may also produce poor
drainage, resulting in unfavorable reduced soil conditions.

Lowland coastal soils. Most mangrove swamp soils along the West African
coast are potential or actual acid sulfate soils (7). In their original swampy
conditions, these soils contain variable amounts of pyrite (FeS) which, upon
aeration of the soil, will oxidize, leading to soil acidification. This also can form high
levels of Fe?* and Al**, which can reduce rice growth and yield.

Marine salinity from sea water intrusion limits rice in some lowland coastal areas
of West Africa. During the WS, with the higher flow volume of the river, gradual
washing reduces salinity.

Considerable research on the development of acid sulfate soils for rice production has been carried out at the Rokupr Station in Sierra Leone. It has been shown
that by proper poldering, salt water from the tidal intrusion can be prevented from
entering the rice-growing areas in Gambia, Senegal, and Nigeria.

Assessment and evaluation of potential rice land in Africa

Soil conditions and land characteristics for the various types of rice cultivation in
Africa have not yet been systematically assessed. A brief assessment of West
African rice growing-areas was made by Moormann (16). Information on east and
central Africa is particularly scarce. Lack of more detailed soil and land-use
surveys in most African countries limits rapid expansion of rice areas in Africa.
According to recent IRAT and FAO land resources survey reports, Cameroon has
substantial areas of potential rice land yet to be fully developed and evaluated. In
Malagasy and Tanzania (Zanzibar and Pemba Islands), most of the rice land is
irrigated and includes a wide range of soils and land types. Even where rainfall is
adequate in mainland Tanzania, rice is less likely to be grown than any other food
crop. However, the country could rapidly expand rice in such areas as the
Kilombero valley, the swamp land in Kimba and Shinyanga regions, and the Rufiji
valley in the coastal region.

Yet to be explored is the use of the three large hydromorphic lowlands, the lower
Niger river delta, the Congo river basin, and the upper White Nile swamps, for rice
cultivation. Although the area of inland hydromorphic soils is modest, compared
to the well-drained upland, it offers higher potential for intensified rice production.
RICE PRODUCTION IN AFRICA: AN OVERVIEW 17

The total area of hydromorphic swamp soil is believed to amount to 2 million ha in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

Biological constraints. Lack of high-yielding improved varieties, disease and
insect pests, weed and vertebrate pests are the major biological constraints. For
raising the yield per unit area, African farmers, especially the small farmers, need
varieties with reasonable but stable yield levels, appropriate growth duration, and
tolerance or resistance to environmental stresses and devastating diseases and
insects. Cramer (5) estimated the world's average yield loss at about one-third of
the value of the rice crop; 13.8% is caused by insect pests, 11.6% by diseases, and
9.5% by weeds. According to Barr et al (4), the yield loss attributable to insects,
disease, and weeds in Africa was 33.7% of the potential production (Fig. I).

Superior varieties. The so-called new plant type, or IR8 plant type, developed by
IRRI in the Philippines, has several attributes needed for high-yield potential. The
MVs have stature and sturdy stems, essential for lodging resistance; short and
erect leaves to utilize solar energy efficiently; and they respond to high levels of
management. The rice varieties From IRRI are further reinforced with multiple
resistance to major insects, diseases, soil, and environmental stresses. In 1973, an
interdisciplinary and problem-oriented rice breeding program, GEU, started with

the goal of incorporating the best characteristics into rice varieties. The major
GEU problem areas include: agronomic characteristics, diseases and _ insects,
drought, adverse soils, deep water and extreme temperature, and grain quality
and nutritional value.

High-yielding varieties, such as IR8, IR5, IR20, IR30, IR36, IR42, IR46, [R1529680-3, and IR1416-131-5, are being grown in several African countries under lowland
rainfed or irrigated conditions. However, African rice ecologies are complex, with
many species of insect pests, plant pathogens. and weed species different from
those of Asia. Varieties best adapted to the complex African ecologies are still to
be identified.

The rice research program of IITA is developing rice varieties adapted to
free-drained upland, hydromorphic, irrigated, and shallow swamp ecologies of
Africa and to associated stresses. The strategy is genetic improvement by
breeding specific adaptational attributes of local African varieties into more
productive genotypes from IRRI and elsewhere. As a result, superior upland rice
varieties developed at IITA, such as ITAH7, ITA141, ITA235 and 257, have
resistance to drought. Bl, and grain discoloration. They are also superior to
traditional varieties in their resistance to lodging and hence respond positively to
higher management.

Under hydromorphics without excessive waterlogging and with good man.agement, the intermediate-statured varieties, such as the IRS plant type, can yield
as well as in irrigated paddies. However, tolerance to Fe toxicity is also important
for hydromorphic as well as shallow swamps. ITA247, developed at ITA
(IR5/Suakoko 8), combines adaptability to fluctuating water tables, tolerance to
Fe toxicity, and resistance to BI. For irrigated conditions, varieties such as ITA212,
ITA121, ITA123, and ITA230 gave yields of 6 t/ha or higher. Varieties including IR42
and ITA121 have been found suitable for low fertility management.

The major achievement of IRAT in Ivory Coast is the development of upland rice
varieties highly tolerant to drought and BI. IRAT109, IRATHO, IRAT142, with short
growth duration (about 100 d), and IRAT104. IRAT156, with medium growth
duration (120-130 d), appear promising.

WARDA is an inter-governmental organization of 15 West African countries,
formed mainly for research, development, and training. The primary sources of
entries for WARDA trials are IRRI, HTA, and IRAT. The special research project of
WARDA at Rokupr is the only center in Africa working on the improvement of
mangrove rice. Among the varieties developed at that station, BD2, ROK4, ROKS.
ROK8, and ROK9 are being used in Sierra Leone. Guinea, and Guinea Bissau.
IR2797-125-3-2-2-2, IR4707-140-1-3, IR4712-113-3-1-2, andIR5677-17-3-1-1, withimproved plant type and medium growth duration, also showed high yield potential
in this ecology.

Insect pests. More than 80 species of insects have been reported to attack rice
in Africa (14). but between 10 and 15 species are considered major pests (I). Among
the insect pests, stalk-eyed fly is indigenous to Africa and is more prevalent in
irrigated and hydromorphic ecologies. Species of lepidopterous SBs and GM
differ from those of Asia. The major insect pests of major importance to rice are

listed in Table 15. In addition, the BPH (Nilaparvata meander Fennah,) and GLH
are considered potential pests (23).

Insects can be controlled by a number of methods, but the use of R varieties is
most effective. This inexpensive method of insect control is also compatible with
other control methods in the IPM approach. Several rice varieties that are R to
insects have been developed by IRRI: however. Africa has some insect pests Asia
does not have. At IITA, researchers are trying to identify the sources of resistance
to SBs, stalk-eyed fly, GM, CW, and RWM. and at present 48 varieties have been
identified as R/MR. Recently, an integrated pest management (IPM) program was
initiated by WARDA in its member states.

Diseases. Fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases often strike African rice. Rice Bl
caused by Pyricularia oryzae is the most widespread and devastating disease in
Africa. The causal fungus of BI varies greatly in pathogenicity. Many lines from
crosses in African land varieties such as Moroberekan, LAC23, 63-68, and OS6,
with high yielding exotic semidwarf varieties at IITA, are resistant to leaf BI.
However, the relationship between leaf Bl and neck BI is not yet well understood.
Recently. an intercenter collaborative task force on BI was formed with IRRI. HTA.
WARDA, CIAT, and IRAT. IITA has major responsibility for this task force in Africa.
RYMV is a potential threat to rice. The presence of RYMV has been confirmed in
Kenya, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal. Upper Volta, and Niger. Thevirology
unit of IITA has developed a technique for detecting the virus using the Enzymelinked Immunosorbent Assay. IITA investigators identified several plants resistant
to this virus. and a breeding program has already been started to develop varieties
R/tolerant to this virus.

Other diseases are HLS caused by Helminthosporium oryzae. leaf scald
caused by Rhynchosporium oryzae, ShB caused by Rhizoctonia solani. sheath
rot caused by Acrocylindrium oryzae. and glume discoloration. In addition, BLB

Xanthomonas translucens f. sp. oyzicola has also been reported in some
African countries. Screening for resistance to glume discoloration and leaf scald
has been emphasized in IITAs research program.

Weeds. Weed control is one of the most labor-intensive operations in rice
production. The yield reduction estimates due to weeds in Nigerian rice
production are given in Table 16.

In upland and hydromorphic rice ecosystems, certain upland weed species
(Rottboellia exaltata L., Commelina spp., Digitaria spp., Echinochloa _ spp.,
Cyperus spp., and Jmperata cylindrica) and certain hydromorphic aquatic weed
species (Fimbristylis spp., Alternantera spp., and wild rice, Oryza spp.) are
problems. They often resist a range of herbicides. Among the aquatic weeds, wild
rice and Jschaemus vogussum are the most difficult to control (2).

Hand weeding in many rice areas of West Africa can require 250-780 h/ha,
depending on the ecosystems, frequency of weeding, and environmental
conditions during cropping. Poor land preparation at planting time can greatly
increase weed infestation. In paddy rice, water management helps control weeds.
In lowland bunded rices, flooding the field to a depth of 7.6-10.2 cm also
suppresses weed growth after transplanting. Burning the stubble after rice harvest
is practiced in several Asian countries. In several countries of Asia and Africa,
hand weeding is the must common practice among small farmers. Time of first
weeding is important; in direct-seeded rice, weeding should begin before the crop
is 3-4 wk old.

For upland, hydromorphic, irrigated, and deep water rice ecosystems, removal
of weeds before seeding largely depends on the area of rice grown and availability
of family labor. Herbicide use is still limited, and the cost-benefit ratio is crucial.

Management

Yield is the expression of interaction between the genotype and the environment;
management creates a favorable or unfavorable environment. Major management factors that determine the crop yield are discussed in the sections which
follow.

Growing season. Except in irrigated rice, the growing season is crucial for all
rainfed rices. Depending on the onset of rains, length of rainy season, and maturity
growth duration of the variety, the time of seeding or raising of seedlings should be
adjusted. In direct-seeded culture, rice is usually seeded after one or two good
showers when soil moisture is sufficient to start germination and to establish the
crop.

RICE PRODUCTION IN AFRICA: AN OVERVIEW 21

Land preparation. Proper land preparation is essential for good stands and
crop growth. In several ricegrowing countries, land preparation commences
soon after harvest of the preceding crop while the soil is still moist enough to be
worked easily. In general, land preparation in lowland rice consists of two to three
alternate plowings and harrowing, depending on soil texture and weeds. Longer
intervals between tillage operations allow weed seeds to germinate and be killed
by subsequent tilling.

In Africa, land is mainly prepared by manual labor using a short-handled hoe. In
tsetse-free areas, draught animals are being introduced, and their use is
increasing slowly. Both the cultivated area and yields could be increased with
more draught animal power and improved animal draught implements.

In large rice production parastatals, such as the River Basin Development
Project in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Tanzania, machines are clearing and tilling the
land. Small power tillers have been introduced in Sierra Leone. However,
mechanization requires an infrastructure for maintenance and repairs, including
availability of spare parts.

For the fragile upland soils of West Africa, conventional tillage leads to soil
erosion. Hence, minimal or zero tillage, using a rolling injection planter developed
by IITA, minimizes soil erosion.

Plant density. Planting rice closer than necessary increases cost and chances
of lodging. On the other hand, spacing wider than necessary means fewer plants
per unit area and this may reduce the optimum yield. Random planting is quite
common in rainfed rice in Asia and Africa, particularly for traditional varieties. The
advantages of straight row plantings are: 1) they are easier to weed, and a rotary
weeder can be used, 2) optimum plant population is possible, and 3) it is easier to
apply insecticides and topdress fertilizers.

Plant density also affects tillering. The tiller number is positively or negatively
correlated with grain yield, depending on the variety and management, especially
the fertilizer application.

For upland rice culture in Africa, planting methods range from random dibbling
to broadcasting and drilling in rows.

The effect of plant densityon grain yield of rice grown with various levels of soil
N in irrigated rice has been reported. The yield of two early-maturing rices
increased by 1.3 t when the plant density was increased from 0.67 X 10Â° (40 x
40 cm) to 106 (20 x 5 cm) hills per hectare (19).

No single spacing is best suited for all varieties. In general, short, lodgingresistant and photoperiod-insensitive varieties, such as IR8, IR36, IR42, and IRSO,
should be spaced 20 x 25 cm in the WS, regardless of soil fertility. In the WS, tall
and leafy, heavy tillering varieties, such as Peta, are spaced 25 x 25 cm in relatively
poor soil and 30 x 30 cm in fertile soils. In the WS, the tall varieties are spaced 30
x 30 cm in poor soils and 35 x 35 cm in fertile soils (7).

Fertilizer management. Fertilizer is a very effective input for rice production but
an expensive one. Fertilizer use in African rice culture is still very low for many
reasons. For example, in Malagasy, only about 9000 ha of rice land, or some
0.77% of the total rice area, receives fertilizer. The rates of application average
22 RICE IMPROVEMENT IN EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND SOUTHERN AFRICA

about 10 kg/ha. In the traditional cultivation of rice under upland, hydromorphic,
and swamp conditions, fertility is restored through the bush fallow system. Soil
fertility is usually not a serious problem for the first and only rice crop following
bush fallow. However, there is little data on fertility management and fertilizer
formulations for continuous hydromorphic, swamp, and upland rice cultivation,
particularly for the Ultisols under high rainfall conditions. Better information is also
needed on the nutrient requirement for the major soils used for rice production.
Recent studies have shown that, besides N, P, and K, zinc and sulfur are also
deficient on certain soil types in the savanna region. The problem of Fe and AI
toxicity in hydromorphic and swamp rice cultivation also requires closer
assessments.

Nitrogen (N). N-use experiments have shown that normally less than 30 to 40%
of the N applied to irrigated rice is recovered. N losses occur in the soil mainly
through nitrification and denitrification, ammonia volatilization, immobilization,
leaching, and ammonia fixation. Hence, method and time of application are
important for increasing N efficiency. Urea and sulfate of ammonia are the two
most common sources of N. Split application of N. one at transplanting and the
other at panicle initiation, are best for high grain yields in the case of medium and
long duration varieties. However, upland rice grown on coarse-textured and
naturally well-drained soils needs a minimum of three split applications - just
before seeding, when the crop begins tillering, and at panicle initiation.

In transplanted rice, preplant N fertilizer should be thoroughly incorporated into
the soil and kept flooded. The second dose may be broadcast. but it is preferable
to incorporate it into the soil by rotary weeders. Fertilizer utilization and grain yield
in irrigated rice are highest when fertilizer is placed at a soil depth of 10 cm
(Table 17).

Phosphorus (P). P deficiency is a widespread nutritional disorder in rice,
second only to N, and Africa is no exception. P deficiency invariably occurs on acid
sulfate soils. Vertisols, and certain Inceptisols (21). The P-fixing capacity of soils is
an important consideration for recommending adequate levels of P for the

desired fertilizer response. The two major sources of P are superphosphate and
rock phosphate. In general, Pis applied at planting. Later application can be made
but not later than the active tillering time.

Potassium (K). Generally, rice does not respond to K as markedly as to N and P.
However, K response is higher in sandy and coarsetextured soils. K should be
applied during the final land preparation.

Zinc (Zn). ZN is a minor nutrient element likely to be deficient inalkaline soils of
Africa. In Zn-deficient soils, a seedling dip of 2% Zn oxide prior to transplanting
produced higher yields in rainfed lowland rice. Incorporation of 10 kg Zn sulfate
per hectare in chronically Zn-deficient areas is also recommended.

Water management. Water management for African rice culture should
include moisture conservation in upland â€˜soils, drainage in valley bottoms and
swamps, and control of the water supply in irrigated rice. Research at IITA on
reduced tillage with mulch showed that the system is effective with water
conservation of upland soils.

Many African countries are expanding their irrigation projects where land
consolidation, leveling, and layout for maximum efficiency of water use is
imperative. Large irrigation schemes are located in Malagasy, Nigeria, Mali, Ivory
Coast, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Tanzania, Cameroon, and Kenya. Major reasonsfor
the decline of irrigation efficiency are frequent breakdowns of machinery and
earth-moving equipment, improper maintenance, and lack of spare parts.

Water requirements vary with the growth stage of the rice plant. In lowland rice,
a depth of 3-5 cm of water is needed during the vegetative stage. However, short
spells of drought stress may not harm the crop during the vegetative stage.

Rice is most sensitive to water stress at the reproductive stage. Water stress
during flowering increases spikelet sterility and decreases grain weight.

In the African rice-growing system, drainage in inland swamps and impounding
water by bunding in rainfed rice are the primary needs for increased production.

Harvesting and postharvest management. Timely harvesting and appropriate
postharvest management are needed to minimize losses. Appropriate harvest
time is more important with traditional varieties that are susceptible to lodging or
grain shattering. Optimum harvesting time for lowland paddy crops is from 28 to
34 d after heading in the DS (18). Overripening of grains increases sun cracking,
especially in long grain rice, thereby reducing the head rice recovery. Alternate
wetting and drying of paddy, either in the field or after harvest, also increases sun
cracking. Paddy must be dried to about 14% MC for prolonged storage.

In most countries of Asia and Africa, harvesting is by manual labor. Use of
appropriate hand tools, usually the sickle, can increase labor efficiency. Use of
combines or power harvesters is suitable for lodging-resistant varieties planted in
TOWS.

Socio-economic constraints

Africa can increase rice production by expanding the area grown in rice and
increasing the yield per unit area. Africa is land rich, and rice production is
labor-intensive; therefore, both options should be properly balanced increasing
production.
24 RICE IMPROVEMENT IN EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND SOUTHERN AFRICA

Investment. This is the primary need for both options. Increasing the irrigated
rice area would be the most assured way of increasing rice production in Africa.
The existing irrigated rice technology of Asia could be adapted in Africa with
appropriate modifications. Currently, large sums of money are being invested in
developing irrigation projects in Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and
Cameroon, to name but a few. Several thousand hectares of inland swamps or
flooded plains could be developed and grown in rice by application of proper
drainage systems. All these development projects need capital investment and
yearly expenditures for maintenance.

Africa particularly lacks trained manpower for research and extension services.
To build up trained manpower also requires long-term investment. Similarly, the
development of infrastructure, such as storage facilities and transport systems for
input and produce, should not be ignored.

Price policies, input supply, and marketing. Effective marketing, timely input
supply, credit management, and price policies are essential to provide farmers
with assured incentives and the means of using improved technology.

Profitability is the main incentive for a farmer to do his utmost for high yield. For
each country, this requires that the government fix and guarantee the price that
will give an income per hectare comparable to that from related crops. The price
fixed by the government must also be aimed at protecting local rice producers
against competition from imported rice. Unfortunately, the cheaper price of
imported rice, with which locally produced rice cannot compete in consumer
acceptance, has discouraged increased production in certain African countries.

Subsidy is a means of promoting production. Purchased inputs such as
fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, tools, and implements may be_ subsidized to
encourage the farmer to use them in improved production packages. The
problem with subsidies is that they are difficult to remove once introduced. Under
such circumstances, the government could aim at a balance between the
guaranteed price of paddy and subsidized input prices.

Credit. In Africa, rice has been promoted in many countries by permitting
farmers to purchase essential services and inputs on credit and to repay the debt
after harvest. In the Masagana 99 Program in the Philippines, loans are issued to
rice growers according to the area of rice they are growing and the need for
purchased inputs. Farm credit systems vary from one country to another, but the
main objective - inducing the rice farmer to adopt improved technology - is
always common. However, as in the case of subsidy, repayment of debts and
loans has several problems.

Improved seeds. A coordinated seed program covering production, inspection,
certification, collection, and distribution is essential. Some African governments
have begun such programs with seed distribution handled by marketing boards.
Several countries are yet to strengthen this essential aspect of their rice
improvement system.

Research and extension. Increased rice production in Asian countries is
achieved by improving the research and extension services. In the past decade,
national research programs have been strengthened by providing trained
RICE PRODUCTION IN AFRICA: AN OVERVIEW 25

personnel, research institutions, experiment stations, and outreach research sites,
plus corresponding extension networks. Africa needs improvement in its research
and extension services. High priority must be given to research areas and
disciplines according to the need of each country. The basic need for strengthening research and extension services must be met through training within the
country as well as at advanced institutions abroad. Refresher courses at all levels
should be offered continuously.

Role of women. Womenâ€™s role in traditional farming is unquestionably
important since, as mothers and housewives, they are often vested with
responsibility for the familyâ€™s nutrition. In typical small-scale peasant families, they
are involved in most of the agricultural operations, particularly during and after
harvest. Women are invariably denied educational opportunities and access to
technological advances and scientific innovations. Women and society will benefit
from access to all of the technical advances, credit, and research and to reduce
mechanization in small-scale farming. The achievement of food self-sufficiency
and better nutrition will depend greatly on removing of barriers that impede the
contribution of women to agricultural development.

AREAS OF FUTURE EMPHASIS

Despite a long history of rice cultivation in tropical Africa, rice research in the
continent is relatively young compared to that in Asia. Until recently, genetic
improvement of rice in Africa was mainly focused on the upland ecology, which
contributes 40 to 45% of total rice production, though it covers about 50% of the
total area under rice. However, the production potential for upland rice in Africa is
much below that of the other ecologies, such as hydromorphic, inland swamps,
and irrigated paddy. This clearly indicates the need for a change in the emphasis
of genetic improvement to more productive ecosystems.

During the last two decades, some of the major insect pests and diseases in
Asia have appeared in parts of Africa. However, none has caused damage in Africa
as severe as in Asia. Conversely, some insect pests and diseases prevalent in
Africa are unknown in Asia. This situation emphasizes the need for research on
specific problems of rice in Africa.

Considering the differences in species of insect pests and disease pathosystems, genetic improvement must be geared toward breeding resistance to
these pests and diseases. More information on insect pests and diseases is still
much needed, especially for central and east African countries. WARDA has been
monitoring the pests and diseases in its member states in West Africa; however,
in-depth studies are still lacking on the biology and epidemiology of pathogens
and on the biology and ecology of important insect pests. Such information
provides the base for a good resistance breeding program and integrated control
approach.

Technicians also need to monitor closely and continuously potentially destructive diseases, such as BLB and virus diseases. Virus vectors, such as BPHs and
GLHs are established in Africa.
26 RICE IMPROVEMENT IN EASTERN, CENTRAL, AND SOUTHERN AFRICA

Among the climatic constraints, cool temperature and drought in rainfed rice,
when compounded with diseases such as Bl, become serious problems. Much
systematic research needs to be done on climate-disease complexes.

Nutritional imbalances, such as Fe toxicity, salinity, alkalinity, and acid sulfate
soils are localized, yet they call for more research and screening for R sources
under specific conditions. Agronomic research in Africa can benefit from the
Asian experience if Asian cultural practices are adapted to suit African conditions.
Independent research has been focused on upland rice, yet more work is needed
on hydromorphic valley bottoms and mangrove swamps, where the growing
conditions are somewhat different from those in Asia.

Rice has a high demand in Africa as a staple food, and the demand will continue
to rise, but production levels at present are still low. However, if research addresses
the major problems, with emphasis on genetic improvement, the potential for
significant increase in production appears very good.

One can safely conclude that the need for more in-depth research on rice in
Africa is imperative. As mentioned previously, the research capabilities of African
countries are much more limited than in other rice-growing countries. Thus, the
international and regional research centers, such as IITA, IRRI, IRAT, and WARDA,
need to help African national programs, independently and in collaboration with
one another, in their respective areas of competency and mandate.

Production projects operated by governments with financing and _ technical
assistance from abroad have proven to be practical and economically viable.
Many governments are keenly interested in rice production projects as a way to
reach self-sufficiency in rice and as an alternative to dependence on small farmer
production. Resolving the problem will require a two-pronged attack, involving
millions of small farmers as well as government projects.

Finally, the overriding factor is the policy of the national governments. The
national economic goals and priorities must favor rice production in Africa.
